## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### How packages are calculated? ###

We'll send all data about height, width, length and weight to Loggi and receive all the calculated packages.

### What is the "try to merge boxes" option? ###

By default every item of order will be one package and we'll send all data to Loggi.

If you activate this option we'll try to agrupate items inside one delivery.

For example, 2 shirts will be calculated together as they are inside the limit for one box instead of calculate the price of two shipments.

### What are the credentials? ###

Your e-mail and API Key from Loggi.

If you do not know your API Key, you can insert your password and will try to retrieve it. [Learn more](https://docs.api.loggi.com/docs/obtendo-suas-credenciais).
